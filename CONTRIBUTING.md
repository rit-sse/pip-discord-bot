# Welcome New Contributors!
We are always happy to have people interested in our project. If you feel like you have something you want to add, feel free to help!

As this is a SSE project, most of our project discussion is located in the [SSE discord](https://sse.rit.edu/). Please find our project discussion in #sse-projects->'Pip' SSE Discord Bot

## Pull Request Process
1) Create a new branch with the name (hyphenated, no spaces) as the ticket/issue the work is under from the Kanban.

2) Make your changes locally.

    a. Add good commit details and decent comments, especially for complex statements of things that seem unintuitive
   
    b. Test your code using a bot token that you've created in your local development environment.

4) Push your branch to github

5) Once your branch is completed, fill out a pull request with the same name as the ticket/issue you are currently working on.

6) Ping @orion_406 or @pawnyy in the project discord channel for review. Include a hyperlink to the PR.

      a. There is a chance that more work will be requested and need to be completed after review. Please keep up to date with all of your active PR's.

7) Once the changes are approved, the code will be merged into the main branch and be "official" and will "work for production"
